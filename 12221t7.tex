\section{Problem}

\subsection*{Identify the objective.}

\begin{frame}
  Emily needed to read a book over the weekend. On Friday after school, she started reading the book from the beginning. That evening she read half the pages of the book plus an additional twelve pages. On Saturday morning, she read half the remaining pages plus an additional nine pages. On Sunday, she read the final forty-seven pages of the book. How many pages long was the book?
\end{frame}

\section{Solution}

\subsection*{Compute the book's number of pages.}

\begin{frame}
  Let $n$ be the book's number of pages.

  How many pages are left to read before Friday?
  \[n\]
\end{frame}

\setcounter{equation}{0} % Place this after each frame that uses equations to reset the counter

\begin{frame}
  Let $n$ be the book's number of pages.

  How many pages are left to read after Friday evening?
  \[\frac{n}{2}-12\]
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  Let $n$ be the book's number of pages.

  How many pages are left to read after Saturday morning?
  \[\frac{\frac{n}{2}-12}{2}-9\]
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  Let $n$ be the book's number of pages.
  
  How many pages are left to read after Sunday?
  \[\frac{\frac{n}{2}-12}{2}-9-47\]
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  Let $n$ be the book's number of pages.
  
  How many pages are left to read after Sunday?
  \[\frac{\frac{n}{2}-12}{2}-9-47 = 0\]
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  Solving for $n$, we have that
  \[\frac{\frac{n}{2}-12}{2}-9-47 = 0.\]
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  Solving for $n$, we have that
  \[\frac{\frac{n}{2}-12}{2} = 9+47.\]
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  Solving for $n$, we have that
  \[\frac{\frac{n}{2}-12}{2} = 56.\]
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  Solving for $n$, we have that
  \[\frac{n}{2}-12 = 112.\]
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  Solving for $n$, we have that
  \[\frac{n}{2} = 124.\]
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  Solving for $n$, we have that
  \[n = \boxed{248}.\]
\end{frame}
