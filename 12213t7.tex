\section{Problem}

\subsection*{Identify the objective.}

\begin{frame}
  At a certain restaurant, if a customer tips $x$ percent, the bill is supposed to be increased by $(x + 8) \%$ to account for tip and sales tax. However, it was found that the automatic tipping system used by the restaurant was using a faulty method: it first increased the bill by $x$ percent, and then increased the resulting amount by $8$ percent. For a bill of \$60 before the tip and the tax, the final cost was 72 cents more than it should have been. How much did the customer tip, in percent?
\end{frame}

\section{Solution}

\subsection*{Find \texorpdfstring{$x$}{x}.}

\begin{frame}
  The incorrect total cost was
  \[1.08 \cdot \biggl(1+\frac{x}{100}\biggr) \cdot 60 = 60 \cdot 1.08 + 1.08 \cdot \frac{3}{5}\cdot x.\]
  \uncover<2->{The total cost should have been \[\biggl(1.08+\frac{x}{100}\biggr)\cdot 60 = 60 \cdot 1.08 + \frac{3}{5}\cdot x.\]}
  \uncover<3->{The difference between these costs was $0.72$ dollars, so \[1.08 \cdot \frac{3}{5} \cdot x - \frac{3}{5} \cdot x = 0.72.\]}
  \uncover<4->{Now we can solve for $x$.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \[1.08 \cdot \frac{3}{5} \cdot x - \frac{3}{5} \cdot x = 0.72\]
  \uncover<2->{\[0.08 \cdot \frac{3}{5} \cdot x = 0.72\]}
  \uncover<3->{\[x = 0.72 \cdot \frac{1}{0.08} \cdot \frac{5}{3} = \frac{0.72}{0.24} \cdot 5 = 3 \cdot 5 = \boxed{15}\]}
\end{frame}

\section{Reflection}

\subsection*{Review the concepts.}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Concepts}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item percents % We needed to understand percents to correctly interpret both costs in order to set up a single variable equation using their difference, which allowed us to solve for the unknown.
    \item single variable equations
